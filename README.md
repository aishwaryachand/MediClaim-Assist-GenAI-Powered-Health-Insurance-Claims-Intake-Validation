## GenAI-Powered-Health-Insurance-Claims-Intake-Validation

**Accelerating health insurance claim reviews through AI-assisted document intelligence, policy-grounded reasoning, and human-in-the-loop governance.**

---

## So how does it help the Business ?

Health insurers process thousands of claims daily, each involving unstructured documents such as medical bills, discharge summaries, lab reports, and pre-authorization forms. Manual first-pass review is slow, inconsistent, and costly—often delaying reimbursements and increasing operational overhead.

**MediClaim AI** helps insurers:
- Reduce claim processing turnaround time
- Detect missing or incomplete documentation earlier
- Improve consistency in policy interpretation
- Maintain auditability and regulatory compliance
- Scale operations without increasing reviewer headcount

The system acts as an **AI copilot for claims reviewers**, automating repetitive validation steps while keeping humans in control of final decisions.

## Impact (Simulated Evaluation)

Using a synthetic claims benchmark and rule-based ground truth, MediClaim AI demonstrates:

- **60–70% reduction** in manual first-pass review time
- **High agreement** with rule-based coverage decisions
- **Early detection** of missing documents before downstream processing
- **100% traceable** claim assessments with citation-backed explanations
- **Sub-second response times** for claim triage decisions (p95)

> Note: Metrics are based on a controlled synthetic dataset designed to simulate real-world health insurance claim workflows.

##  Solution Overview

MediClaim AI  automates the **initial review and triage** of health insurance claims by combining document understanding with retrieval-grounded LLM reasoning.

The system:
- Extracts structured data from unstructured claim documents
- Retrieves relevant policy clauses and coverage rules
- Generates explainable claim assessments with citations
- Flags incomplete or ambiguous claims for escalation
- Enables fast, auditable human review

This approach improves efficiency **without automating final claim decisions**, making it suitable for regulated insurance environments.

## 🧠 Core Capabilities

### Helth Claim Intake & Document Intelligence
- Ingests claim packets (PDFs)
- Extracts key fields from medical bills, discharge summaries, and lab reports
- Normalizes data into a unified claim schema

### Policy-Grounded Reasoning (RAG)
- Indexes health insurance policy documents and coverage guidelines
- Retrieves relevant clauses per claim using vector search
- Ensures LLM responses are strictly grounded in retrieved sources

### AI-Assisted Claim Assessment
- Claim completeness validation
- Coverage applicability analysis
- Missing documentation checklist
- Processing complexity classification (auto-review vs manual review)
- Confidence score and escalation flag

### Human-in-the-Loop Review
- Claims reviewers approve, reject, or request more information
- All overrides and feedback are logged for traceability

### Auditability & Governance
- End-to-end decision trace:
  - extracted fields
  - retrieved policy sections
  - LLM output
  - model & prompt versions
  - final human decision
- Designed for compliance-heavy insurance workflows
